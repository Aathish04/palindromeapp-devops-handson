# Hands-On Session on GitHub DevOps CI/CD - 30/10/2023

This repository contains code and instructions to be followed during the Hands-On Session on Github DevOps CI/CD. Please read through this README file carefully before and during the session.

## Prerequisites

We will need some software to be installed on your system before we can begin the session. Here's what you'll need:

1. **Git**
    - Git is a version control system that tracks changes in code. It works by creating snapshots of code over time, allowing multiple people to collaborate on a project while preserving a history of changes and enabling easy branching and merging of code.
    - The Git Guides on Github are a great source on how to install git to your system: https://github.com/git-guides/install-git

4. Now, you need to create a Github Account, if you don't have one already.
    - Follow the instructions [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/signing-up-for-github/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account) to set up a new Github account.
  
Once you've done that, move onto the next piece of software you will need:

3. Java (OpenJDK 17)
    - You may already have a version of Java installed from working on other projects such as the Semester IV DBMS or Semester III OOPS project.
    - **To follow along in this session, you will need Java OpenJDK 17, so please be sure to install it.**
    - Follow the instructions [here](https://java.tutorials24x7.com/blog/how-to-install-openjdk-17-on-windows) to install OpenJDK 17 on Windows.
    - On Debian/Ubuntu/Kali, install the latest version of Java by running `sudo apt update && sudo apt install default-jdk` in the command line,
    - On MacOS, you can install Java using the instructions [here](https://www.codejava.net/java-se/install-openjdk-18-on-macos). If you have the Homebrew Package manager, you can install Java by simply running `brew install java`.

Once you've installed Java, the next piece of software you will need is:

4. IntelliJ Idea Community Edition IDE
